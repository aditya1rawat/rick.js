> Wanna rickroll your website's viewers? Enter **rick.js**, a zero-dependency, 25 line JS library designed to make rickrolling easy.

Just place the following right before your closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="path/to/rick.js"></script>
<script>
    Rick.init();
</script>
```

Then, add the `rick` class to any `<a>` tag on your website.
